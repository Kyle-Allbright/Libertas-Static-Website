# Libertas-Static-Website
Running prototype of the Libertas Dapp served via static website.

# Running the code
Download the code and run the pages from any local host. The Demo page will work on its own too thus furthering decentralization.

# WHAT IS LIBERTAS
Libertas is a decentralised public blockchain and cryptocurrency project. Using blockchain technology content is distributed amongst many nodes in the network instead of a single source such as YouTube or Facebook - Libertas is politically unbiased, censorship resistant and immutable.

We are developing a smart contract platform which seeks to provide the world's first decentralizded audio and podcast streaming service.

Content cannot be removed or deplatformed. Trustless ownership provides content creators and node providers with rewards.
